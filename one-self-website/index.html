                        From Amazon and ASOS to Zappos and Zillow, every website that you visit collects information about you. What you bought, how long you spent looking. Those companies use your data to personalise your experience and sell to you more effectively. With 1self, you can collect that information and use it yourself.

                        Your phone is the hub around which your world of data spins. It’s laden with sensors and apps, all of which are constantly collecting data about you. Currently that data is hived off and kept separate within each of your apps and you don’t even get to see most of that information. With 1self, you can bring your phone data to life by collating it and connecting it and deriving new insights from it.

                        Have you heard of The Internet of Things? If not, you soon will. There are already 25 billion internet connected “things” in the world and that’s growing fast. These things range from buses to sneakers and from bracelets to surfboards. These things collect data about the environment they’re in and that environment often includes you. What are they saying about you? With 1self, you can collect that data and find out for yourself.

                        Data doesn’t tell you much on its own. 1self brings your data to life by automatically connecting and correlating it to produce interesting, useful and actionable insights about your life. <p>Maybe, if you go to bed earlier you could earn more money. Or if you took a different route to work you’d be less stressed all day. With 1Self you can find out.<p>
