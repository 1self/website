Dev loggio landing page, outline

* Why you would hook into loggio
	* Every time a user interacts with your app / software you create an interesting data point
	* your users are generating a gold mine of data
	* help get that back to them
	* create a story of your touchpoints with your users
	* easily recognise the last time a user interacted with your app
* How easy is it
	* 3 lines of code to store the data
		* var loggio = require('loggio')
		* var eventStream = loggio.create('dhdlskd38384dhkd', '12345678')
		* eventStream.add({'type': 'app:open', 'name':'guitartuner'})
		* model.ClaimYourEventStream = eventStream.url
	* easier than setting up a database
	* anonymous data feed
	* the users can then use this to build a numbers based picture of their life
	* set the data free
	* convenient place to store your data without having to setup a backend
	* ui developers - should there be a different pitch? Pre-canned html/javascript to get jquery ui folk to store stuff.
	* libraries in all major languages
		* c++
		* c#
		* java
		* python
		* javascript
		* objective-c
		* ruby
		* php
		* perl
* cool visualisations
	* get access to a set of great visualisations
	* interactivity
	* pre-canned - give an example of what the code would look like
		* var interactiveGraph = loggio.graph(eventStream, '#graphCanvas')
	* users can compare themselves to others
