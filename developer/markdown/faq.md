# 1self FAQ

> **Will you sell my data?**
Nope. Never. (Unless you want us to)

> **Is my data private?**
Yes. All of your data is private by default. You can share your data and insights with your friends or the world if you choose to though.

> **Is my data secure?**
Yes. All data is transferred over secure protocols.

> **Will you give my data to the NSA/GCHQ/[Other national security agency]?**
Not if we can help it.

> **Can I make money from my data?**
If we can get this whole thing up and running then we think there will be opportunity for you to make money from your data. We’re working with companies to create a market whereby you can opt in to sell your data and get it working for you.

> **I’m a developer, can I write integrations with your platform?**
Yes, absolutely. We love developers. Developer documentation is here.

> **Why do you charge to use 1self?**
We want to offer you a great service that is built for you. We want to have a transparent value exchange - we provide a great service and we hope you’re happy to pay a small fee for it. We think this is a better model than giving you the service for free and then selling your data. There will always be a free version of 1self to use though.



> **How will 1self make money?**
> Right about now you’re probably thinking, “So, I could earn shares in

> anything. 1self is only going to be worth anything if it makes money.
> How’s 1self going to make money?”

> Good question!

> We’d like to make it a paid service because we have a cast iron

> They own their data and we provide a service to help them make the
