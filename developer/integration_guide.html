<p>The event api is a REST api that lets you sent JSON representations of events to feed into 1self visualisations. Events are added to streams and streams are added to users. Visualizations aggregate and filter events from streams and users into beautiful, commentable presentations of useful information.</p>

<p>Before we get into the details of the rest calls, you should understand how to represent your user’s behaviour as events. Then you can send them to 1self and use the 1self visualization stack. Let’s dive into events.</p>



<h1 id="events">Events</h1>

<p>Events describe behaviours in the world around us by describing actions performed upon objects. For example, you might write computer software or brush your teeth. To create visualisations of these behaviours we use a tagging schema that captures the object and the action, along with some measurements for that event. The object is a noun and the action is the verb. </p>

<p>Let’s imagine that a smart toothbrush manufacturer wants to let their users collect, compare and comment on their brushing behaviour. We’ll use the brushing behaviour as an example and and show how we can turn it into events that feed the 1self visualizations. We’ll start with how we would communicate that behaviour to another person.</p>

<p>I brush my teeth.</p>

<p>All 1self events start with a person, that’s the ‘I’ in the sentence. We don’t need to encode that information, it is assumed in the 1self platform. Next, we have the verb, the action, which is ‘brush’. The object, the noun, is ‘teeth’. Let’s take these elements:</p>

<table>
  <tbody><tr>
    <td>object</td>
    <td>teeth</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>action</td>
    <td>brush</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>These describe the event, but we could be more precise by adding more tags. Teeth are in the mouth, they are a part of your anatomy, they are oral. Adding these tags allows us to differentiate between brushing your teeth at night and brushing the teeth of your bike gears. We make an educated guess when someone says I brush my teeth that they mean the teeth in their mouth. In 1self, we add the details needed on the object.</p>

<table>
  <tbody><tr>
    <td>object</td>
    <td>teeth,oral,mouth,</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>action</td>
    <td>brush</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>The action only has one interpretation. The action of a brush moving around on the teeth. There is another way to express this though. You might say ‘I clean my teeth’. For that reason we should add the clean verb to the action.</p>

<table>
  <tbody><tr>
    <td>object</td>
    <td>teeth,oral,mouth,</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>action</td>
    <td>brush,clean</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>We could go further, but this captures enough information to be able to classify this behaviour, and importantly give us hooks to be able to relate it to other kinds of oral health behaviour, like flossing your teeth. We’ll come back to that later. <br>
</p><aside>There’s nothing in a stream that prevents you from changing your object and action tags. There’s also nothing to stop you changing the object and action tags between different calls to add events. The schema is implicit. However, picking tags and sticking to them means that you’ll be able to visualise them all together easily.</aside> <br>
Now that we have a description of the behaviour, what things about the behaviour would we like to measure. The obvious one to measure is the duration. How long you spent brushing. Brushing teeth doesn’t tend to take more than a few minutes. That means we can use duration as the measurement, which in 1self is taken to mean duration in seconds. Another measurement, since our imaginary smartbrush supports it, is the pressure that you are using to brush your teeth. Pressure can be represented in newtons or in kilograms per square metre.  Measurements go in the properties like this<p></p>

<br><br><table>
  <tbody><tr>
    <td>object</td>
    <td>teeth,oral,mouth,</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>action</td>
    <td>brush,clean</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>properties</td>
    <td><table>
    <tbody><tr>
        <td>duration</td>
        <td></td>
    </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>pressureKgSqm</td>
        <td></td>
    </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p></p></td> 
</tr> 
</tbody></table> <br>
We can put other kinds of information in the property like who makes the toothbrush. We can also add the colour.

<br><br><table>
  <tbody><tr>
    <td>object</td>
    <td>teeth,oral,mouth,</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>action</td>
    <td>brush,clean</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>properties</td>
    <td><table>
    <tbody><tr>
        <td>duration</td>
        <td></td>
    </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>pressureKgSqm</td>
        <td></td>
    </tr>
            <tr>
        <td>make</td>
        <td></td>
    </tr>
            <tr>
        <td>color</td>
        <td></td>
    </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p></p></td> 
  </tr> 
</tbody></table> <br>
Every behaviour happens at a point in time, so our event needs to date and time, abbreviated to datetime. The datetime allows 1self to slice and dice the events along the time dimension. <br>
Our completed table describing the structure of the event is:

<br><br><br><br><br><br><table>
  <tbody><tr>
    <td>object</td>
    <td>teeth,oral,mouth,</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>action</td>
    <td>brush,clean</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>properties</td>
    <td><table>
    <tbody><tr>
        <td>duration</td>
        <td></td>
    </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>pressureKgSqm</td>
        <td></td>
    </tr>
            <tr>
        <td>make</td>
        <td></td>
    </tr>
            <tr>
        <td>color</td>
        <td></td>
    </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p></p></td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
    <td>datetime</td> 
    <td></td> 
  </tr> 
</tbody></table> <br>
When someone brushes their teeth this template is used to create an event. Let’s fill the details in. <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/jun/19/science.health">According to the Guardian</a> the ideal brushing time is 2 minutes and the ideal pressure is 150grams. We’ll use these values to create our event. We’ll say that the make of the toothbrush is the ‘Brushomatic5000’ and the color is red. <br>
<aside>If we have more than one color of Brushomatic5000 or another colour, by adding the make and color, we will be able to slice, dice and compare the data for the different values. By adding them as properties we have created additional potential dimensions through the data. <br>
There’s also nothing wrong with logging different kinds of events in the same stream. If we had a very peculiar toothbrush / tooth flossing multi device we could log both behaviours in the stream. If both had the ‘clean’ object tag, when visualising the stream you could show combined duration for both, or add the brush / floss tags to show only one behaviour or the other. <br>
</aside>

<br><br><br><br><br><br><table>
  <tbody><tr>
    <td>object</td>
    <td>teeth,oral,mouth,</td>

Now we have decomposed our behaviour into an event, we can dive into the technical details of the rest api endpoints you call to get the event into 1self for visualization. <br>
First let’s turn the event we have created into a JSON representation ready to send to the API:



<pre class="prettyprint"><code class=" hljs bash">{
    <span class="hljs-string">"objectTags"</span>: “teeth,oral,mouth”,
    <span class="hljs-string">"actionTags"</span>: “brush,clean”,
    <span class="hljs-string">"properties"</span>: {
        <span class="hljs-string">"duration"</span>: <span class="hljs-number">120</span>,
        <span class="hljs-string">"pressureKgSqm"</span>: <span class="hljs-number">0.15</span>,
        <span class="hljs-string">"make"</span>: “Brushomatic5000”,
        <span class="hljs-string">"color"</span>: <span class="hljs-string">"red"</span>
    },
    <span class="hljs-string">"datetime"</span>: “<span class="hljs-number">2014</span>-<span class="hljs-number">11</span>-<span class="hljs-number">11</span>T22:<span class="hljs-number">30</span>:<span class="hljs-number">00.000</span>Z”  
}</code></pre>

<p>Before we can create an event we need a stream to write the event into. A stream is a logical grouping of events. It includes tokens for reading and writing events. Like events, streams are created by the apps that capture behaviour. Once a stream is created and has events in we can ask 1self to visualise that stream in a barchart. <br>
Let’s look at the method that creates a stream. <br>
POST <a href="https://sandbox.1self.co/v1/streams/">https://sandbox.1self.co/v1/streams/</a> <br>
Authorization: clientid:clientsecret <br>
The post doesn’t expect a request body. It does, however, need an clientid and clientsecret which you <a href="http://www.1self.co/developer/#!/api">get from here</a>. An application is a client of the api and the clientid uniquely identifies it. The clientsecret is used by the client to prove that it the application registered with 1self. The method call returns 3 pieces of information.</p>

<table>
  <tbody><tr>
    <td>streamid</td>
    <td>unique identifier for the stream. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>readToken</td>
    <td>a cryptographic token used to grant read access to the events in the stream</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>writeToken</td>
    <td>a cryptographic token used to grant write access to the stream. This is used to write events.</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>This information comes back as a JSON object representing the stream</p>



<pre class="prettyprint"><code class=" hljs json">{
    "<span class="hljs-attribute">streamid</span>": <span class="hljs-value"><span class="hljs-string">"YBEBZPADSKPUDXBG"</span></span>,
    "<span class="hljs-attribute">writeToken</span>": <span class="hljs-value"><span class="hljs-string">"0d9a60e8001895a977c33eead02e32b18b1c6d2e2d5c"</span></span>,
    "<span class="hljs-attribute">readToken</span>": <span class="hljs-value"><span class="hljs-string">"51eb4902856e30a11dc5153e1e65cac7aab3390cf67d"</span></span>,
}</code></pre>

<p>Now that we have all the details of the stream, a call can be made to the stream to persist the event. The stream is represented at the endpoint <a href="https://sandbox.1self.co/v1/streams/YBEBZPADSKPUDXBG">https://sandbox.1self.co/v1/streams/YBEBZPADSKPUDXBG</a>. On this stream, there is a sub resource ‘events’ which can be written to and read from, the address of which is <a href="https://sandbox.1self.co/v1/streams/YBEBZPADSKPUDXBG">https://sandbox.1self.co/v1/streams/YBEBZPADSKPUDXBG/events</a>. <br>
To make the post request we put the write token in the authorization header, set content-type to application/json and add the event in the body of the request</p>

<br><br><br><br><table>
  <tbody><tr>
    <td>POST</td>
    <td>https://sandbox.1self.co/v1/streams/YBEBZPADSKPUDXBG/events</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>headers</td>
    <td>
    <table>
    <tbody><tr>
    <td>Authorization</td>
    <td>0d9a60e8001895a977c33eead02e32b18b1c6d2e2d5c</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Content-Type</td>
    <td>application/json</td>
    </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p></p></td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
    <td>body</td> 
    <td>

</td></tr></tbody></table>

<pre class="prettyprint"><code class=" hljs rsl">{
    <span class="hljs-string">"objectTags"</span>: [“teeth”,”oral”,”mouth”],
    “actionTags”: [“brush”,”clean”],
    “properties”: {
        “duration”: <span class="hljs-number">120</span>,
        “pressureKgSqm”: <span class="hljs-number">0.15</span>,
        “make”:”Brushomatic5000”,
        “<span class="hljs-keyword">color</span>”:”red”
    },
    “datetime”: “<span class="hljs-number">2014</span>-<span class="hljs-number">11</span>-<span class="hljs-number">11</span>T22:<span class="hljs-number">30</span>:<span class="hljs-number">00.000</span>Z”
}</code></pre>

<p> <br>
 <br>
 <br>
The server will return a value of 200 to indicate that the POST was successful and the event that was added to 1self. That event looks like this.</p>



<pre class="prettyprint"><code class=" hljs 1c">{
    <span class="hljs-string">"event"</span>: {
        <span class="hljs-string">"createdOn"</span>: <span class="hljs-string">"2014-11-12T17:55:08+0000"</span>
    },
    <span class="hljs-string">"payload"</span>: {
        <span class="hljs-string">"dateTime"</span>: <span class="hljs-string">"2014-11-11T22:30:00.000Z"</span>,

    }
}</code></pre>

<p>The event that was sent to 1self is put in the payload. Two further properties are added to the payload, the streamid from the rest url and the eventDateTime which is the the time that the event was created by the server.  <br>
</p><aside>The values of dateTime and eventDateTime will be different if events are sent to 1self some time after they are created. This may happen particularly on mobile where an internet connection is not always present. </aside><p></p>



<h1 id="visualisation">Visualisation</h1>

<p>Once the event has been successfully saved the application can show a visualisation to the user by constructing a url and giving it to a browser or web view. To construct a URL you need the following component pieces:</p>

<table>
  <tbody><tr>
    <td>streamid</td>
    <td>The streamid that was created and used to write the event</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>objects tags</td>
    <td>The object tags that we used in our events</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>actions tags</td>
    <td>The action tags that we used in our events</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>aggregation function</td>
    <td>The aggregation sum, mean or count that should be show in the visualisation</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>time rollup</td>
    <td>the unit of time to roll the data up into. day, week or month.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>visualization</td>
    <td>The visualization to show. Currently only one value is supported: barchart</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>as well as the URL we need to give the readToken from the stream that we are going to visualise. This was returned by the call to create the stream. For tooth brushing, the visualisation will be a bar chart showing the total duration of brushing per day. The complete set of information that will be passed up is:</p>

<table>
  <tbody><tr>
    <td>streamid</td>
    <td>VWEWRPHUEBLMUVIG</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>objects tags</td>
    <td>teeth,oral,mouth</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>actions tags</td>
    <td>brush,clean</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>aggregation function</td>
    <td>sum(duration)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>time rollup</td>
    <td>daily</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>visualization</td>
    <td>barchart</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>read token</td>
    <td>51eb4902856e30a11dc5153e1e65cac7aab3390cf67d</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>The URL must be formed from the following template: <br>
<a href="">https://sandbox.1self.co/v1/streams/{streamid}/{objecttags}/{actiontags}/{aggregation}/{timerollup}/{visualization}?readToken={readToken}</a> <br>
WIth our set of data the URL, once filled in, looks like this: <br>
<a href="https://sandbox.1self.co/v1/streams/VWEWRPHUEBLMUVIG/teeth,oral,mouth/brush,clean/sum%28duration%29/daily/barchart?readToken=51eb4902856e30a11dc5153e1e65cac7aab3390cf67d">https://sandbox.1self.co/v1/streams/VWEWRPHUEBLMUVIG/teeth,oral,mouth/brush,clean/sum(duration)/daily/barchart?readToken=51eb4902856e30a11dc5153e1e65cac7aab3390cf67d</a> <br>
Nothing should be passed in the request body. The response will contain an html representation of the visualisation. This can be parsed by the client, however this endpoint is designed to be called by a browser. In the case of a native application, the native application should pass the generated url to a browser or web view and allow the browser to render it. <br>
The visualisation contains the start of a login, commenting and sharing flow that is handled by the browser.</p>
