    <p>Integrating with 1self is free. It costs nothing to send events and show user’s visualizations about themselves.
        Request an api key <a href="/developer/#!/api">here</a> to get started.</p>

    <p>However, we <strong>do</strong> need to prevent runaway costs that might be caused by someone sending us huge
        numbers
        of events. We’ll do that with a generous, flexible limit - to be figured out during the beta. Indie developers,
        hobbyists, you’re unlikely to ever hit the limit. But, if you’re a profit generating company sending us massive
        amounts of events, we’ll need to have a conversation.</p>

    <p>This information may be subject to change whilst we’re in our beta period.</p>

    <p>Any questions or for more details, <a href="mailto:team@1self.co">get in touch</a>.</p>
