    <h1 id="introduction">Integration Requests</h1>

    <p>Below are some of the integrations that our users have already requested for 1self.</p>

    <p>Remember, once the data is in 1self, the user will be able to make lots of use of it. They'll be able to see
        visualizations of the data by different time periods (by day, by week, by month). They'll be able to compare
        their activities with friends. They'll be able to see trends of change over time. They'll be able to correlate
        one piece of data with another (do I take more photos on a sunny day?) They'll get prompted with interesting
        insights ("yesterday you listened to the most minutes of music ever!").
    </p>

    <p>So, when you're considering which integration to build, think about all of the interesting outputs that could
        come from that data :) </p>

            <li>Email
                <ul>

            </li>
            <li>Activity trackers

                    <li>Fitbit, Misfit Shine, Nike Fuelband, Jawbone, Moves.</li>
                    <li>Our users would love a way to unify the data that they collect with these different devices.
                        Once you've done one it'll probably be easy to

            <li>Withings Scales (and other Withings products)

                    <li><a href="http://oauth.withings.com/api">Withings provide a good API</a>. There are lots of
                        interesting analyses that could be done from the data collected by the Withings scales. Also,
                        they're a very cool bit of kit - if you like data then you'll love them!

            <li>eCommerce (particularly Amazon and supermarkets)
                <ul>
                    <li>Allow users to see how much they're spending and on what. Later the information could be
                        expanded to show how much fruit and veg people buy per week, for example.
                    </li>
                    <li>This is a bit of a tricker one as eCommerce companies don't tend to open up APIs to give access
                        to what people bought. However, all the information tends to be available in the order
                        confirmation emails sent by these companies, or within the DOM when the order confirmation pages
                        are shown...
