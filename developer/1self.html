<p>1self allows users to collect, compare, correlate and comment on all of their data. 1self’s flexible, adaptable platform let’s users collect all the measurements they care about in 2 ways:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li><p>Using 1self, users manually collect any measurement they can imagine</p></li>
  <li><p>By providing an API for developers to automatically send user’s measurement data </p></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>This guide is for developers, rather than users. Use cases for the API can be found here &lt;&gt;. Two types of developers will find this guide useful: Application developers and integration developers. Application developers engage users through API provided visualizations. Integration developers connect existing data, such as Twitter or Facebook, to the 1self Platform.</p>
