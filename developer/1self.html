<p>1self allows users to collect, compare, correlate and comment on all of their data. 1self’s flexible, adaptable platform let’s users collect all the measurements they care about in 2 ways:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li><p>Using 1self, users manually collect any measurement they can imagine</p></li>
  <li><p>By providing an API for developers to automatically send user’s measurement data </p></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>This guide is for developers, rather than users. Use cases for the API can be found here &lt;&gt;. Two types of developers will find this guide useful: Application developers and integration developers. Application developers engage users through API provided visualizations. Integration developers connect existing data, such as Twitter or Facebook, to the 1self Platform.</p>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>The API is a vertically integrated storage, analytics and visualization application stack for human measurement. Events, representing human measurements, are fed into 1self. The developer calls an API which provides event visualizations and insights to the user. Developers describe event metadata and values, 1self does everything else.</p>
