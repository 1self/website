<h2 id="1self-faq">1self FAQ - for end users</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Will you sell my data?</strong> <br>
  Nope. Never. (Unless you want us to)</p>
  
  <p><strong>Is my data private?</strong> <br>
  Yes. All of your data is private by default. You can share your data and insights with your friends or the world if you choose to though.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Is my data secure?</strong> <br>
  Yes. All data is transferred over secure protocols.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Will you give my data to the NSA/GCHQ/[Other national security agency]?</strong> <br>
  Not if we can help it.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Can I make money from my data?</strong> <br>
  If we can get this whole thing up and running then we think there will be opportunity for you to make money from your data. We’re working with companies to create a market whereby you can opt in to sell your data and get it working for you.</p>
  
  <p><strong>I’m a developer, can I write integrations with your platform?</strong> <br>
  Yes, absolutely. We love developers. Developer documentation is here.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Why do you charge to use 1self?</strong> <br>
  We want to offer you a great service that is built for you. We want to have a transparent value exchange - we provide a great service and we hope you’re happy to pay a small fee for it. We think this is a better model than giving you the service for free and then selling your data. There will always be a free version of 1self to use though.</p>
